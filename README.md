## Description
This is a simple README.md generator that runs on the terminal using Node.js.  It uses a series of questions prompting for user input to gather info about the project in question.  These questions use the inquirer toolset.  Input is then used in a template to generate a README.md file.  A video showing the creation of this README can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/198syHN_3RJZNRasUjzH88IugOgmLYDxf/view.  These last two sentences were added on afterwards since the video had not been created yet.
